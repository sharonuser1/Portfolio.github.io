            I’ve been fortunate to gain hands-on experience both academically and in industry. Below are some key highlights of my journey:

            <h2>👩‍💻 CoderDojo Volunteer — Maynooth University</h2>
            <p>
                My first technical experience began at university, where I volunteered with <strong>CoderDojo</strong>.
                I collaborated with other demonstrators to guide children aged 8–16 through coding exercises using <strong>Scratch</strong> and <strong>Microbit</strong>.
                It was a highly engaging, hands-on experience that helped develop my mentoring and communication skills.

            <h2>🧑‍🏫 Computer Science Center (CSC) Tutor — Maynooth University</h2>
            <p>
                In my second academic role, I worked at the <strong>CSC</strong> where I tutored first-year students.
                I assisted with weekly assignments, coding projects, and provided one-on-one help with various programming challenges.
                This experience improved my problem-solving and peer support skills.

            <h2>🏢 Unum Internship (Taster Program) — Industry Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I was selected for a two-week internship with <strong>Unum</strong>, a U.S.-based insurance company with its tech operations in Ireland.
                I shadowed professionals across different roles, attended team meetings, Q&As with former & current interns, and had 1-on-1s with
                <em>Delivery Managers</em>, <em>UX Researchers</em>, <em>Business Analysts</em>, <em>Developers</em>, and <em>Software Engineers</em>.
                This gave me first-hand insights into the corporate tech world.
